### Weekly Essay

This was by far the hardest part of the apprentice program, today I feel more relaxed, I did learned about the open-source culture, which was something I always wanted to be a part of, because it has a lot of great ideas behind it, like collaboration between programmers to build an useful piece of software that everyone can use, and if interested, read the source code, everything is transparent in this projects, from the code itself to the discussion on how to solve issues, and even code proposals that are rejected.

I feel somewhat confused about my performance regarding the understanding of big code databases, on my research question I was able to explore the PostgreSQL source code successfully finding the files that I believed where important for solving my question, it helped that every folder had a README with brief descriptions of each file. For my investigation I used the O'Reilly media account, which I learned about at the hub, and read the 'flex & bison' book by John Levine, I discovered many things about those compiler tools and also got invested into automata theory concepts. 

The thing I'm most disappointed about is with the contribution part of this activity, I started by searching a project I would be interested in, I used a good website called [Good first issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/).
