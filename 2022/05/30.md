### Weekly Essay

This was by far the hardest part of the apprentice program, today I feel more relaxed, I did learned about the open-source culture, which was something I always wanted to be a part of, because it has a lot of great ideas behind it, like collaboration between programmers to build an useful piece of software that everyone can use, and if interested, read the source code, everything is transparent in this projects, from the code itself to the discussion on how to solve issues, and even code proposals that are rejected.

I feel somewhat confused about my performance regarding the understanding of big code databases, on my research question I was able to explore the PostgreSQL source code successfully finding the files that I believed where important for solving my question, it helped that every folder had a README with brief descriptions of each file. For my investigation I used the O'Reilly media account, which I learned about at the hub, and read the 'flex & bison' book by John Levine, I discovered many things about those compiler tools and also got invested into automata theory concepts. 

The thing I'm most disappointed about is the contribution part of this activity, I started by searching a project I would be interested in, I used a good website called [Good first issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/), targeting two specific languages (C++ & Python), I quickly realized that C++ projects were more complicated to work with, and I tried finding a project in Python that was both challenging and interesting.

My first pick was [sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy), I tried to understand how to use the library, mostly from reading tutorials and watching video-tutorials by the lead maintainers of the project, I struggled a little bit building the project, I read the guide on how to contribute and at the end when I had the project finally working, I was not able to understand how to properly run the tests, so I changed my focus to another project, in retrospective I didn't take enough time in trying to found out how to properly do that, I should have asked for help at that moment. 

The second project I tried to build was [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy), again I was able to get the dev environment running, I read about its code of conduct, documentation and their code styling, I was able to run the tests but couldn't find an issue that was easy enough to solve. 

Finally I started working with the [geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas) library with this [issue](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/issues/2325) in mind, again I had to read through the documentation to get the development environment started, also I read their contribution guide, and learned a lot about dependencies, I was able to figure out how test worked, and hot to write additional tests, before claiming an issue I wanted to make sure I'll be able to solve it so I tried my best to find the piece of code that could help me doing that, but I felt overwhelmed, I could have communicated with the developers to ask for questions regarding the issue, but I wanted to make some investigation first to not arrive with empty hands, and this wasn't a good strategy at all, because I got lost with the source code.  

I realized that I still need to work with my communication skills, I faced a scenario in which the work I had to do didn't depend on myself alone and as a consequence I wasn't able to complete the task and doubted my technical abilities a lot.
