### How does a DBMS parse a SQL query?

To answer this question first we need a little bit of context.

#### Scanning and Parsing

Parsing is the process of analyzing a string of symbols conforming to the rules of a formal grammar.

In order to do that first we need to analyze the stream of characters or symbols and group them together into meaningful chunks of information called lexemes. This is normally the job of a program called *scanner*.

Lets say for example that we are analyzing the next expression

```
operation = 1 * 2 + 3 * 4 + 5
```

Then the scanner will produce as an output the next sequence of tokens

``` 
<id,1> <=> <1> <*> <2> <+> <3> <*> <4> <+> <5>
```

Then the parser's job is to figure out the relationship between those tokens, usually it's represented as a parse tree.

```    
       =
      / \
     +  <id,1>
    / \
   +   5
  / \
 *   *
/ \ / \
1 2 3 4 
```
#### Flex and Bison

Flex is a program that generates programs that perform pattern-matching on text, while bison is a parser generator.
