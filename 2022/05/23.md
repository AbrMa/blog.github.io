### Weekly Essay

I started this week by reading some articles on the hub about all the resources available for learning. I found the o'reilly platform very useful for the question assignment, I read about 3 chapters from the book "flex & bison" by John Levine, in which he describes with the right amount of detail how those two pieces of software work together for the lexical analyzer and the semantic analyzer in a compiler.

I refreshed my JS knowledge by practicing some exercises that involved concepts like arrow functions (which I always found a confusing concept) and destructuring. I did this with the objective of having a better understanding of the react framework.

I read a part of the PostgreSQL source code, I liked the way the project was structured, because it was somewhat easy to find the [files](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/tree/master/src/backend/parser) that I was most interested in.

I think I focused too much in the research of the question and overanalyzing certain aspects of it.

I did underestimate the task of the contribution to the open source project, I dedicated a lot of time in trying to find interesting projects in python and c++ which are the languages I feel most comfortable with, I overlooked the complexity of building those projects. I had a special interest in the [sympy
](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) project, I started by reading documentation related to the software itself, how to use it, how to contribute to the project, the code of conduct and how to properly build and generate a pull request to the project, but all the time invested was not worth it, because I had some troubles while building the dev environment. I think that it was a good idea to not directly ask for the assignment of an issue, because I would not have been able to fix it, and it would have been a waste of time for both myself and the maintainers.

I'm overall worried because I haven't been able to choose a project to start working, and I noticed that work that depends on many parts can be a lot more complicated, but that's something I'll have to deal with if I wanna become a good developer. I will need to find a better strategy for solving my current issue, the problem is that at the time of writing I can't come with any solution, I will have to use the technique from the "Learning how to learn" course and try to enter diffuse mode hoping to both relax and find a more suitable solution.

### How does a DBMS parse a SQL query?

*Work still in progress*

To answer this question first we need a little bit of context.

#### Scanning and Parsing

Parsing is the process of analyzing a string of symbols conforming to the rules of a formal grammar.

In order to do that first we need to analyze the stream of characters or symbols and group them together into meaningful chunks of information called lexemes. This is normally the job of a program called *scanner*.

Lets say for example that we are analyzing the next expression

```
operation = 1 * 2 + 3 * 4 + 5
```

Then the scanner will produce as an output the next sequence of tokens

``` 
<id,1> <=> <1> <*> <2> <+> <3> <*> <4> <+> <5>
```

Then the parser's job is to figure out the relationship between those tokens, usually it's represented as a parse tree.

```    
       =
      / \
     +  <id,1>
    / \
   +   5
  / \
 *   *
/ \ / \
1 2 3 4 
```
#### Flex and Bison

Flex is a program that generates programs that perform pattern-matching on text, while bison is a parser generator.
