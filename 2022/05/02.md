### Weekly essay

By far the most important thing I learned this week was that software developers need to listen to their clients very carefully, understanding and answering the questions they ask is key for having good communication.

I discovered more concepts related to quantum computing that made me think a lot about the possibilities that this new field can bring to the table, specially in terms of computing power, since things such as cryptography are gonna become obsolete, it's very interesting to me that this concept was around many years ago, I first heard of this topic back in 2018, but still I can't understand the details about it, and as I discovered in the videos many of the professionals that are somewhat familiar with quantum computing concepts don't know why things behave the way they behave in the quantum realm, because it really doesn't make sense, so it's a little bit of relief to hear that.

I really liked the idea behind pretotyping, because it allows for experimentation and failure, testing ideas is very important, because as we've seen in past weeks failing leads to learning new things, and also is a very intelligent way of discarding ideas that are not worth pursuing.  


### Monthly essay
During this first month I enrolled in the course called ''Learning how to Learn'' which I enjoyed a lot, it goes trough various techniques for getting the most out of the material that you are studying, It showed me a lot about the bad habits that I had specially how to deal with procrastination, and why it happens, I used the pomodoro technique while doing most of my activities and I notices an increase in my overall productivity.

I started giving lighting talks to other apprentices and mentors, I learned a lot while doing this activity, because it's not something I used to do, and it has helped me improving my communication skills and understand that other people might no be familiar witch certain topics, the feedback was very helpful to help me notice this kind of details, although I didn't like my last lighting talk, I wasn't very familiar with that topic and it showed.  

We also learned a lot about team work, the codejam exercises were my favorite activity of the month, I really liked working on these type of exercises, the most challenging part was learning other programming languages, and coordinating with other apprentices to get the job done on time.
