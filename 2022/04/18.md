This week was very tough, the most exiting thing (and also the most difficult) was the java excercise wich consisted in completing a missing pice of code in this [repo](https://github.com/Nearsoft/academy-exercises). I got confused a lot with the maven installation, but thanks to Adalberto's advice I used homebrew for making the installation process a lot easier, I learned that the set-up enviorment part of a project is very time consuming if not familiar with the technologies, and also by getting thrrown at a project with no previous knowledge forces you to find soulutions on the internet, but also is a great oppurtunity for learning new concepts, I don't like java, nontheless ideas are the most important part for solving a problem since the language is only a tool for making those ideas come to reality. To be honest I didn't fully understand how the recomendations algorithm worked, and I only used as a black box, I think that this is something that can apply to real word projects since you don't need to understand all the parts of the code as long as you reach your objetive, and can make a functional piece of software.
