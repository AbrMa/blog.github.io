### The Myth of the Genius Programmer

It's very common to think that those who have written very important pieces of software are all geniuses, that they have gone into deep states of concentration to achieve this, and when we as normal programmers try to do the same thing, we somehow feel that everything in the software development process must be perfect, and that we don't want to show our progress until our code it's good enough, because weÂ´re scared of failure, and we have the need to hide it, when in reality it's part of the process, hiding our code from other people might lead to failure and it can have a negative impact in development of our project. 

It's fun to code alone, but it's better to write code with others, we must drop our ego and be more colaboratory. Also we need to know how to give and receive feedback. After we fail the most important thing it's to learn, the more you fail the more you learn, and with practice you're gonna become better eventually. 

I do agree with being a small fish, because it forces you to learn, if you are very comfortable with the things you might be doing you might not be in a favorable position to learn new things.

Projects should star well defined, so that other contributors don't take it into another direction.
